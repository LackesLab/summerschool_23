# SummerSchool 23: Time Series Analysis & Generative AI

## Introduction

Welcome to the SummerSchool 23 course on Time Series Analysis and Generative AI at Hochschule Karlsruhe! This course aims to provide an in-depth understanding of two of the most transformative areas in artificial intelligence and data science: Time Series Analysis and Generative AI.

### Why Time Series Analysis?

Time series data are ubiquitous in real-world applications. Whether it's stock market data, climate trends, healthcare records, or sensor readings in industrial settings, the ability to analyze and make predictions based on time-series data is crucial. This course will offer you the tools to perform advanced analytics, feature engineering, and create predictive models.

### Why Generative AI?

Generative AI is at the frontier of artificial intelligence research and has been responsible for some of the most exciting developments in the field. From creating realistic images, videos, and voice recordings to generating text and even composing music, generative models have wide-ranging applications. Understanding the principles behind these models is vital for anyone interested in the future of AI.
